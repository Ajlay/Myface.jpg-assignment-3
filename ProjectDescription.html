						  <h2>Ranking of our skills in demand from employers</h2>

<p><b>Aidyn: </b><br/> 
	The general skills that are in demand from employers for data analysts are communication skills, writing,  and teamwork/collaboration.</p>
<p><b>Sam (Mun Kit): </b><br/> 
	The general skills required in my ideal job are analytical skills, communications skills and teamwork/ collaboration, both communication and teamwork are one of the most highly demanded skills however analytical skills are less often demanded from employers.</p>
<p><b>Owen: </b><br/> 
	As a Cisco Network Engineer, the general skills required include communication skills ranked #1 on the Burning Glass(2018) Generic Skills list, problem solving ranked #2 and, analytical skills #17.</p>
<p><b>Zach: </b><br/> 
	The general/generic skills required from my ideal job are “good communication”, “documentation skills” , “excellent time management skills” and “the ability to prioritize tasks.” Good communication ranks as the #1 most demanded skill, documentation skills is not on the graph, time management is #12 on the list . The ability to prioritise tasks isn't directly listed on the graph, but a similar quality, organisational skills is listed as #3 on the list</p>
<p><b>Harrison: </b><br/> 
	For database administrators, problem solving, troubleshooting and organisational skills are some of the most important skills that are in high demand, although collaborative and communicational skills are also highly important.</p>
<p><b>Teodore: </b><br/> 
	The general/generic skills that are essential to my ideal job include communication skills, problem solving, organisational skills, writing, team work, planning and creativity.</p>

<h2>Our three highest ranked IT-specific skills that we dont have skills in</h2>


<p><b>Aidyn: </b><br/> 
	The three highest ranked IT-specific skills that are not required in data analyst is Javascript, JAVA and project management.</p>
<p><b>Sam (Mun Kit): </b>
	<br/>The three highest ranked IT focused skills in terms of demand from employers are SQL, Javascript and JAVA all three of which are not in my required skill set.</p>
<p><b>Owen: </b><br/> 
	The highest ranked IT focused skills not within my chosen ideal job of a Cisco Network Engineer include SQL ranked #1 on the Burning Glass(2018) IT Skills, Project Management ranked #5 and Business Management ranked #7.</p>

<h2>Our new views on ideal jobs</h2>

							
							
<p><b>Aidyn: </b><br/> 
	After viewing the data from Burning Glass my opinion on my ideal job has changed in terms of the scope of what I can pursue after university, I have found that data jobs that use SQL seem to be more in high demand, this helped reinforce my pursuit for a job in the data realm and also highlight that there is many more in demand jobs over data analyst that I should look into before making it my ideal job.</p>
<p><b>Sam (Mun Kit): </b><br/> 
	Even after looking at the Burning Glass data my opinion of my ideal job has not changed however I am open to more options as there are more higher ranked jobs in demand which interest me like Java developer which can boost my chances to securing a job as one of the highest demanded skills is in JAVA/ Javascript is needed.</p>
<p><b>Owen: </b><br/> 
	Reflecting on the Burning Glass data, I have realised that the job title of a Network Engineer is definitely a lot more difficult to find work than i expected. Whilst it is not explicitly shown on the list, a Systems Engineer which is of similar nature is ranked second last on the list. Working with data is obviously a growing field in the IT industry judging by the fact that SQL skills are ranked #1 in active selections.</p>
<p><b>Zach: </b><br/> 
	Looking at the data presented, it appears that the job title i have chosen, the specific skills and general skills are all in high demand, which will provide a high paying job with such skills. If the job title and skills required with it do not change in the coming years, my opinion of my ideal job has not changed.</p>
<p><b>Harrison: </b><br/> 
	After looking at the Burning Glass data, I can see that database administrators are relatively low in regards to importance for employers, only ranking 11th place on the top occupations data, and instead a more general network/system administrator might be a more ideal job if I wish to pursue the management of data/systems, seeing as that ranks fourth in the top occupations data provided by Burning Glass.</p>
<p><b>Teodore: </b><br/> 
	The Burning Glass data hasn’t changed the opinion of my ideal job as I already knew that being a Creative Director for a game company wouldn’t have the same demand as most IT jobs, due to its unique specialisation. The demand of this job isn’t what attracts me to it, it's the creative outlet and the passion I have for creating something of my own. But I don’t want to solely pursue this passion, I would like to first find some stability with my work by getting into the IT industry for practical and well paying jobs so that I can build up a safety net.</p>
