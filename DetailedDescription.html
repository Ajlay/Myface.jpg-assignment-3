					    <h3 class="major"> What does it do?</h3>
							<p>Raspberry Pi’s, Arduino’s, Makey Makeys are a set of devices classified as single-board microcontrollers. Single-board microcontrollers are similar to a fully functioning PC in many ways, as they include a microprocessor, I/O circuits, a clock generator, RAM and stored program memory; essentially smaller versions of most parts you’d find on your day to day desktop or laptop. However, in the case of microcontrollers such as the Raspberry Pi or Adruino, all of those components are built onto a single printed circuit board, one that can fit in the palm of your hand. Single-board microcontrollers have been favoured by new developers and innovators for a while now as they come with an open supply hardware, they are suited for operation with many OS and they’re very simple to use. The huge processing power in such a compact board and the many interfaces it supports also make it so highly favoured by many. Microcontrollers have many many uses that make them versatile and able to be used by experienced developers and computer beginners at the same time. They have been used in the past for complete desktop replacements, media centers, retro gaming machines, servers and many other automation processes. Anything that you could imagine a low end fully functioning PC could do, single-board microcontrollers such as the Raspberry Pi can do just as much. As the first Raspberry Pi was only released in 2012 and the first Arduino was released in 2005, these are relatively new machines in the context of other products in the computing world. As the computing industry grows and companies learn how to make smaller and smaller computers that run faster than each one before it, microcontrollers have been growing with them. Each year all the competing companies are releasing new iterations of their products with more compact designs, faster processors and more capability.</p>
							<h3 class="major">What is the likely impact?</h3>
							<p>With microcontrollers such as Raspberry Pis and Arduinois excelling at single defined tasks to such a level of efficiency, they're likely to be implemented in many many ways seen all around the world. Microcontrollers can be seen in use in many automatically controlled products and devices, such as car engine control systems, medical devices, remote controls, office machines, appliances, power tools, toys and other systems you might find embedded in something else. With the development of new and improved microcontrollers, this will allow many new developers and innovators to think differently when it comes to computers and give them a platform to experiment with that is easy to learn and cheap to fund As these devices become more advanced, so does the level of intelligence, automation and potential for the devices that they’re implemented in. Although these devices may not replace or make any jobs redundant in the foreseeable future, it is likely that having the set of skills to use a microcontroller in a way that is efficient and useful to a company could become sought after.</p>
							<h3 class="major">How will this affect me?</h3>
						  <p>Microcontrollers have been affecting everyone in their day to day life more than most people would assume. They may not realise, but when they are using a toaster, setting their alarm clock, driving their car, using a printer, a keyboard or a telephone system, microcontrollers are being used in all of those devices, right underneath their nose. The advancement of microcontrollers and their efficiency means the devices regular people use every day will have the capacity to become smaller, more efficient and all be running off a board smaller than their thumbnail. Over time we will all experience, but might not see the development of these technologies. &nbsp;</p>

						  <h2 class="major">Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h2>
							<img src="images/technologies2.png" width="450" height="299" alt=""/>
						  <h3 class="major"> What does it do?</h3>
							<p>Cryptocurrencies have been on the rise since early 2009, with the creation of Bitcoin. Stemming from earlier work performed by David Chaum in the 1980s, he aimed to create an anonymous and cryptographic-based system of money which could be untraceable by the bank, government, or similar third party. </p>
						  <p>(Lansky 2018) provided six conditions in order to fulfil the requirements of a cryptocurrency, which are as follows:</p>
<ol>1. The system is maintained through distributed consensus, not a specific central authority.</ol>
<ol>2. The system has an overview of how much of a certain currency is in existence and who owns it.</ol>
<ol>3. The system defines when/how new units are created, as well as the reason why they have been created and who owns it.</ol>
<ol>4. Ownership can only be proved cryptographically.</ol>
<ol>5. The system allows transactions in the exchange of cryptographic units, and statements of transactions can only be issued by an entity proving their current ownership.</ol>
<ol>6. If the same unit is transferred several times at once, the system can only perform one at most.</ol>
						  <p>Blockchain technologies are used as the ‘system’ to record and control the majority of cryptocurrencies. There are a large number of digital storefronts that currently accept mainstream cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Etherium as payment in lieu of standard money.</p>
							<p>This being said, due to the open-source nature of this technology, it takes very little for an independent party to set up their own blockchain and launch their own cryptocurrency, which is colloquially known as “altcoins”. Notable examples of these often become popular for memetic reasons, such as Dogecoin, which launched in 2013 and recently has increased in popularity thanks to efforts on websites such as TikTok.</p>
							<h3 class="major">What is the likely impact?</h3>
							<p>Bitcoin has not seen many particularly huge developments when it comes to the mainstream economy over the years since its inception. In spite of that, it has had a significant increase in value in recent times, evident by it surpassing the $2 trillion value in April 2021 after ‘rising from around $750 billion at the beginning of [2021].’ (Bambrough 2021, para. 3) This can likely be attributed to the interest in the stock market, such as the aftermath of $GME stocks rising significantly, where public interest in cryptocurrencies have similarly risen.</p>
						  <p>While this likely is not indicative of any great social change that is to arise with cryptocurrencies becoming the mainstream form of economic growth, there is a possibility that cryptocurrencies may eventually be considered a more mainstream form of currency outside of the (mainly) internet presence it has at current. This would be difficult to achieve however, due to the electrical and anonymous design of cryptocurrency which means that it has a very low chance of rendering anything outright redundant.</p>
							<h3 class="major">How will this affect me?</h3>
							<p>It is unlikely that I will experience any drastic change in my personal life, seeing as I do not currently invest in any cryptocurrencies nor does any of my friends or family. Because of the inherent anonymisation of cryptocurrencies and as prior stated, it is unlikely it will cause any significant social change in a wider community that would change my life to any dramatic extent. This being said, there is a possibility that cryptocurrencies could maintain their meteoric rise to popularity, which could ultimately result in me and/or people I know investing in one form or another.</p>
						  <p>The short-term possibility of this is dubious however, and as such I do not view cryptocurrencies as an immediate importance in regards to my personal life beyond an occasional interest from an outside perspective.</p>

				<!-- Autonomous vehicles -->

						  <h2 class="major">Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
							<img src="images/technologies3.png" width="450" height="297" alt=""/>
							<h3 class="major"> What does it do?</h3>
							<p>Autonomous Vehicles are primarily cars that allow users to get to a location without the need of any manual input from the driver during the driving process of getting from point A to B, this is done through a combination of cameras, radars, sensors software which is ran through a fast processor which learns the environment and makes actions depending on where the car needs to get to. The latest in this technology are mainly concept cars without steering wheels or reinvented wheels with more futuristic and advanced body designs that look more like a movie prop than a functional vehicle.  Currently the most state of the art autonomous cars available on the market are made by Tesla, however Tesla vehicles still need partial user input to prevent the computer from having a major error on the road, while in autopilot the user can indicate and watch the screen to make sure if the car is making the correct decision on the road, however for the safety of the user the car makes sure the user keeps their hands on the wheel and by moving the steering wheel or braking it will deactivate the autopilot, it also has a final safety procedure to stop the car if the driver is no longer responsive where it will slow down the car and make loud noises to wake up the driver then will go to a standstill and turn on hazard lights if there is still no response by the driver. Autonomous vehicles will likely be changed in the future to give full autonomy to the vehicles compared to the current semi-autonomous cars we have now and have more accurate driving and more advanced safety features. Within the next 3 years there will likely be a push for more electric vehicles with autonomous capabilities to take over gas-based vehicles, making more car companies develop their newer vehicles without a gasoline engine and being fully electrical, which would increase the number of drivers having access to an autonomous vehicle, however I believe that it is unlikely for cars to become fully autonomous in the next 3 years as the technology hasn’t advanced far enough since the debut of the autopilot from Tesla, which still has many issues today and can cause crashes if not carefully used, we are more likely to have semi-autonomous vehicles become very common in the next 3 years as user input is still needed on our roads due to not all vehicles being autonomous. In the beginning of autonomous vehicles general motors created one of the first autonomous vehicle that was controlled via radio fields, nowadays we now use a slew of technologies to make autonomous vehicles functions on their own, some of these technologies include GPS, lidar, cameras, radar and ultrasonic sensors, each one needed to make an autonomous vehicle function, the GPS is utilised to position the car on a map so it knows where is currently is, the lidar prevents the car from hitting obstacles by checking the distance of the vehicle to an obstacle, the cameras are used to show users the front and the back of their car while driving while also collection information about the road like the road lines and speeds, radar sensors are used to determine speeds of the car, ultrasonic sensors are used for parking the vehicle by determining smaller objects distance to the car, all of these separate technologies have come together to build the autonomous vehicle and is a massive advancement over radio frequencies used previously.</p>
							<h3 class="major">What is the likely impact?</h3>
							<p>In the future autonomous vehicles impact may be immense, to the point where driving is not involved at all and becomes more like a train ride to any location, this will also affect the environment and its pollution levels which will climb higher momentarily due to the mass production of electric vehicles in which the producing the batteries cause the greenhouse gases levels to rise, currently gas cars would create less compared to when creating a battery for an electric car, this is mainly due to how costly it is to mine and create precious materials needed to create the batteries, while gas cars have become more efficient with the use of petrol, and the use of hybrid based vehicles which have better fuel economy as well. However, while the batteries create pollution, in the long term pollution will become more reduced over time as the car will produce zero pollution while operating it. We will likely see a shift over to all cars being electric and having autonomous capabilities soon, however there is doubt that the vehicles will become fully autonomous anytime soon. The use of autonomous vehicles affects all of those who have a driving licence and those who are obtaining/obtained a driving licence as it can minimise the need for it in the future being that there is no need to drive the vehicle, which may cause driving licenses to become redundant, furthermore making the need for taxi drivers to be less likely if there is no license needed to operate an autonomous vehicle making many jobs in the commuting category redundant. Another aspect that autonomous vehicles can help in is clearing up traffic as drivers no longer will be able to cause stop and go situations as the vehicle will be able to presume its next step with regards to every other car.</p>
							<h3 class="major">How will this affect me?</h3>
							<p>In my daily life this will affect how I transport to and from a desired location. I would no longer need to drive and pay attention to the road as the car would have automatically done it for me and it will reduce the likeness of me using a train/bus to get to a desired location, being that I can go directly to a location I desire whereas getting close to it using a bus/train, it would also make me never consider using any sort of uber or taxi service as I would be able to save more money having my own car drive itself, and since I would not need to pay for petrol, presumably I would have more money left for spending elsewhere every time I get money . Once autonomous vehicles are the norm a major difference for me would that I would have to get rid of all the cars at my house which don’t have autonomous capabilities which would intern mean that I would not need to drive a manual car anymore, making it so that I would no longer feel stressed managing my cars gears when driving, as the car would be independently managing itself making it a lot easier to get to a place. The shift to autonomous vehicles would also affect my friends making them more available to have more outings as most of them currently do not have a licence, and if autonomous vehicles do not require any licence this would make it so we would go out more often and at later times with most of us sharing cars whereas my friends only being able to drive one passenger at a time due to red P plate restrictions, which would help us avoid this and make us more active outside rather than staying home most of the time talking digitally, making our social lives better. </p>

				<!-- Robots -->
					<section id="main" class="wrapper">
						<div class="inner">
						  <h2 class="major">Robots</h2>
							<img src="images/technologies4.png" width="450" height="626" alt=""/>
							<h3 class="major"> What does it do?</h3>
							<p>Robots are autonomous machines programmed by a computer which is capable of sensing the surrounding environment, making computations to conclude decisions and ultimately performing actions in the real world. Robots are commonly found in automotive manufacturers to perform repetitive tasks that would be normally dangerous to humans, however they can also be found in other respective fields like medicine, military tactics, cleaning and exploration of other planets. Currently robotics are rapidly evolving and transforming at a fast speed with an estimated 50 millions robots installed worldwide. Boston Dynamics are the most renowned when it comes to autonomous robots, creating ‘Spot’ the agile mobile robot used for capturing data safely, accurately and frequently and also ‘Atlas’ the world’s most advanced humanoid robot. NASA is also known for their robots, famously sending multiple autonomous robots called ‘Mars Rovers’ to Mars to collect and gather data about the planet. The robotics field is already a massive field and will continue to grow and expand in the following years as new robotic developments occur.</p>
							<h3 class="major">What is the likely impact?</h3>
							<p>The impact of the rapid development and popularity of autonomous robots has had an impact on a variety of jobs all around the world. Almost all car part manufacturers have been introducing robots into the production line to do the tasks to save company costs. This has affected many people working in the car manufacturing sector as it is cheaper to now use robots instead of human labour making workers redundant. Robots will continue to replace human jobs at an estimated three million Australian jobs could be lost to robot automation over the next 15 years. However this can also create new job opportunities for those in the I.T sector as there will now be an overwhelming demand for them as robots continue to be integrated in not only the business sector but also in our daily lives.</p>
							<h3 class="major">How will this affect me?</h3>
							<p>The integration of robots is not a new concept and it is something we have all seen and grown up with being born in the 21st century. Robots will continue to influence us as a group specifically as we are all working in the I.T sector therefore creating a lot more chances for us to graduate into the workforce. The main difference we might see in the future is the further integration of robots into our daily life style but also the losses of jobs specifically not in the I.T to robot automation which can ultimately affect members of our family or close friends.</p>
