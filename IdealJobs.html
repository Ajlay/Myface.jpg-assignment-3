							<!-- Teodore Ideal Job -->
							<p><b>Teodore: Creative Director - Dice</b><br/>
As a Creative Director it is your job to bridge together multiple departments to create a unified creative vision that fills the intended project goals. You essentially act as the authority over aspects of the game such as the gameplay, visual style, story, audio assets, cinematics, and marketing materials. DICE is a subsidiary of the controversial Electronic Studios, but they have developed many first-person shooters that I love to play such as the rebooted STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT series. That part that is most appealing to me about being a Creative Director is the entire process of creating and developing a project. I love exploring all my creative possibilities, seeing what sticks and what does not and trying to find more ways to be fresh and innovative. I want to slowly evolve these ideas and create a strong vision of what the completed product should look like. But the most important part is putting in the work to make this vision a reality, when I am dedicated and passionate about something, I will put my blood, sweat and tears into any project to try and realise my ideas and see it through right till the end.<br/>
-	Experience in shipping at least 1 AAA title as a creative director <br/>
-	+8 years’ experience in game development 
These qualifications are important as DICE is a well-respected AAA publisher, they need to make sure that those who manage their projects are of the highest standards and already comfortable to do what is asked of them.<br/>
But in addition to these qualifications, I need to be quite comfortable with public speaking to represent the creative studios and also good with structure and documentation to maintain a high level of quality and process control.</p>

							<h2>Ideal Jobs Discussion</h2>
							<p>As can be seen in the comparison table above, our ideal jobs share some similarities, but also differences. With Owen, Zach and Mun Kit’s ideal careers all mainly tackling management and maintenance of software and hardware, these three jobs all relate to each other. Mun Kit’s Support Technician job deals with the maintenance side of I.T, as the job title suggests. Owen and Zach’s ideal jobs on the other hand relate more so the engineering aspect of creating networking systems and infrastructure. Aidyn and Harrison’s ideal jobs focus on a different aspect of the I.T industry, databases and datasets. With their ideal jobs being Data Analyst and Data Administrator, it is obvious that similarities will be present in these jobs. Both deal with interpreting datasets, and also how to deconstruct them into something meaningful. However, Aidyn’s Data Analyst ideal job interprets datasets with the use of improving and developing products for the company of Reecetech. On the other hand, Harrison’s Data Admin job interprets datasets with the purpose of aiding in research to advise clients on the data that they are collecting.</p> 
                                                        <p>The wildcard ideal job here is Teodore’s, which is a Creative Director of a AAA video game publisher DICE. To dissect this role, similarities in jobs can be seen in the requirement to have good teamwork and team leadership skills which is of course imperative as a successful creative director. Mun Kit and Owen’s ideal jobs also require good team work skills to fulfill their roles. Zach and Teodore’s roles also require good ability in documentation and time management. In contrast, Teodore’s ideal job requires not just 8+ years experience in the video game industry, but also fantastic public speaking abilities to represent the video game studio.</p>
                                                        <p>Overall, it is apparent that these ideal job roles all share some similarities, but also many many differences. This is a testament to how vast the IT industry is, and how all of us want to follow different career avenues. </p>
