							<p>For assignment two our group had a slower start compared to other groups however, as we incorporated more meetings into our schedule we could combine our efforts and really flesh out the details of the assignment and start assigning and completing sections and once we got the ball rolling we kept maintaining that pace for the following weeks. We got into a sense of rhythm for every meeting, where we would discuss what we had to do next and who would do it. This pace led us to complete the assignment a couple of days before the due date and would use the extra days to touch up on minor details we had missed previously. Overall our group really melded together and we had no real and major complaints about each other.</p>

							<p>In assignment 3 our group will focus on honing in on due dates, as in assignment 2 we had some ambiguous due dates like, ‘this week’ or ‘sometime in the next couple days’ this really cut down on our productivity levels which did not really affect assignment two as we were already ready before the due date. However this could possibly affect our assignment 3 progress as it is a more detailed version of assignment 2 and any wasted time could affect the quality of our work and the amount of details we can include in our project plan.
