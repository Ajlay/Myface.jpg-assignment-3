							<h1 class="major">IT Professional Interview</h1>
							<p><b>IT Professional:</b> Matthew Bulloch <br/>
								<b>Former Positions:</b> Data Strategist and Program platform coordinator <br/>
								<b>Current Position: </b> Senior Manager of program platform coordination at DJPR<br/></p>
							<img src="images/matthew_bulloch.png" width="217" height="290" alt=""/>
							<p><b>Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</b><br/><br/>       
Bulloch works within the state government, DJPR. Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions. He is the manager of a very small team that is responsible for the change management of grants database systems. Also been involved in some planning and delivery of system upgrade projects and with higher-level decision making. Such as presenting options and system solutions to senior executive management.<br/><br/>
Change management is about how you introduce new digital projects that will improve the database enterprise system to make sure that they are adopted successfully by users. As well as change management he is involved in liaison and coordination with system users.<br/><br/>
The team recently went down from two team members to one but the team member that left is currently on a 3-month secondment and will return soon. He did not want a big team in the first place as it makes it easier to manage. Daily work consists of scrum meetings to update the progress of work and blockers.<br/><br/></p>
							
							<p><b>Please tell us about the industry you work in.</b><br/><br/>
								Within this IT Industry Bulloch works with software in the Public/Service Government industry. He works in a branch called the Program Centre where he is responsible as a centre of excellence for the design and development of best practiced grant programs for the business sector. Within the Program centre there is a team called the digital transform team, they are responsible for the development and improvement of the grants management software system.</p>
							
							<p><b>What other kinds of work do you have to do?</b><br/><br/>
								Bulloch’s main role is around change management including some of the project management and high-level executive decision making. Co-chair the meetings he has to prioritise new development ideas and options. He also works on Hyper-care which is the process of monitoring a new subsystem or widget that is released to find out if there are any discrepancies with the data. <br/><br/>
Within 2020 there was a majorly increased workload that was required of him. He has had almost 1 million grant applications in 2020, while in the previous year DJPR only had 10,000. Hypercare had to make sure that everything was working well, when looking at the figures of over 10,000 applications it was quite clear that there was a problem. Found out that Centrelink's system of validating healthcare cards was fundamentally broken with only around half of the cards being verified. <br/><br/></p>
							
							<p><b>Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them</b><br/><br/>
								Bulloch works closely with other members such as Business Analysts, who measure how things fit into processes. He also interacts with developers and programmers as they are needed to complete the changes for the database systems. Before publishing the changes, he works with QA testers, to see them try their best to break the system by testing every eventuality they can think of. <br/><br/>
When the change is released, he trains and informs the delivery teams in how to use the new features effectively. He operates on 5 or 6 projects at any time along with the other 100 people in the change management department.<br/><br/></p>
							
							<p><b>Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</b><br/><br/>
								Most of the work and interactions he makes is within the digital transformation team. But he also has some interaction with data analytics teams who are responsible for reporting dashboards of intelligence. He works with them as they are a major stakeholder in using the system and are good at dealing with live data.<br/><br/>
Most of his work is just meetings. 7 Hours of meetings out of an 8-hour workday. But every meeting has a purpose, every meeting is to make decisions or to update something. There is a lot of coordination that needs to go on to make sure that everything works together consistently. There is a trade-off, you cannot coordinate everything because then you will get very little work done. A balancing act is made in making sure that everyone is informed and that there is sufficient time to complete the work.<br/><br/>
Bulloch has been working on grants programs for two decades unlike the other developers who have only work on building the systems. Brings some experience to the table and deeply understands the needs of the users.<br/><br/></p>
							
							<p><b>What about your interactions with clients or investors?</b><br/><br/>
								No real direct interactions with clients or investors. He is just providing them with the system to make it possible and work.<br/><br/></p>
							
							<p><b>What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these</b><br/><br/>
								Meetings, Project management, Team Coordination and providing Technical Support. This work is all communication based and is vital within these large industries to make sure that everything is working attune.<br/><br/></p>
							
							<p><b>Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</b><br/><br/>
								The Team Management and relationship management with the broader team environment. There is a lot of Politics involved in how decisions are made and the influencing of executive decisions where you may not have that direct opportunity to speak to the people who make decisions.<br/><br/>
Dealing with executive decision making as decisions that are made at higher levels do not have the same understanding of the situation as those who are actively working on them.<br/><br/></p>
							
							<p><b>Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</b><br/><br/>
								Bulloch was involved with the Project management in the approval and design of a software subsystem that would properly validate the healthcare card status of applicants. He was involved from the inception of the idea, was able to drive, lead, and present it. Aside from leading the technical team in the development, he even wrote some of the programming code because everyone else was already preoccupied. <br/><br/>
Bulloch was getting the project in place and ready for the next round of grant applications which would open in May. However, on the very day of this interview the project was cancelled, due to reasons that were not to do with the project’s performance or completion. <br/><br/>
There are some decisions that are out of your control that you just have to get used to.<br/><br/> </p>
