							<h2>Group Reflection</h2>

									<h3>Aidyn Lay</h3>
									<p>I think that overall our work went smoothly once our conversations ramped up and work was assigned, allowing us to then target our sections and build the assignment quickly. I believe we worked well after some rough ends were fixed however in the future we could try and plan meeting dates better. A thing I found surprising with this group is how quick we were to pick up the pace after having a slow start and all members being able to manage themselves and complete their sections. In the end I have learned that time management is a crunch due to online learning and timetables colliding between 6 people, in the future this will make me reconsider separating meetings  into smaller groups and having more meetings when this occurs.

									<p>In our group what when well was that we always had a plan on what we needed to do and who was gonna do it, however what could be improved was setting meeting dates, which is not something we can necessarily control but there was sure to be one or two time slots where we could have all met. Something that was surprising to me was that everyone got what they needed to get done no one was behind. Something I can take away from this group experience is that it's very difficult to align 6+ schedules with each other to get a meeting.

									<p> In my opinion, the work of our group has been strongly in order to achieve the target of finishing before the due date of the project. While we didn’t start as early as we could have, I think we regardless set appropriate goals when it came to designating the work to each group member which ultimately helped us in finishing the project without any severe delays. Seeing as everyone has had largely equal input when it comes to the work, without anyone in specific attempting to take control in directing the other group members. One thing that I found surprising was the way that everyone managed to synergise without any conflicts when it came to designating the work and figuring out who would do what tasks. One thing that I have learned about working in a group however is that I need to prioritise getting my research and other work into a presentable format faster, because the majority of contributions to this project document were later than the others due to me keeping it to myself for the sake of proofreading.

									<p>I would say that our group as a whole were really agreeable and easy going, it was simple and straightforward to plan out how to attack the workload. Planning meeting dates is definitely an area that could be improved, as it was often difficult for all of us to be readily available to be in a meeting. One thing that was surprising was that nobody slacked behind in terms of getting work done. Something I learnt from my group is how difficult working online and collaborating can be, I never realised how indirectly helpful it is to see your group mates in real life, as online it is difficult for all of us to be available at the same time to have group meetings. However I did learn that Google Docs is a great tool to work within a group virtually.

								  <h3>Teodore Bulloch</h3>
									<p>Our group has been quite effective in achieving the goals of this project. Everyone in the group has been friendly and engaged with the assignment, with everyone contributing to the project in different ways. The only area that would need further development for our group would be our meetings. We would often have conflicting arrangements that would prevent us all from properly meeting up, but sometimes we would forget to check our messaging applications and would miss a meeting. Due to these factors we haven’t completed as many meetings as we would have wished. The most surprising thing about working in a group was how shared the responsibility was between everyone. People weren’t being forced to do work by an unofficial group leader, everyone was willingly engaged and helped in the way they wanted to. What I’ve learnt about groups in this assignment, was that without allocating parts of a project to certain users, progress could be slow. When working on a project individually you have a greater sense of urgency to do all the work, but with a group the expectation of finishing the work can be diverted away from yourself, onto your other team members. That's why work allocation is so important in groups, by breaking up the assignment, there are clear roles and responsibilities for each team member to fulfill.

									<p>The overall workflow and productivity of the group ended up being pretty good in my opinion. Although we initially had a slow and rocky start, not knowing where to begin and what idea to choose for the project idea portion of the assignment, I still think we managed to overcome those roadblocks and get lots of work done. Even though we also had less meetings than we probably should’ve, I could tell that everyone was committed to making the meetings we had the most productive as possible, with everyone putting in equal amounts of work done and ideas contributed. One thing that could be improved was our productivity in the first 2 or so weeks, as we had a slow start. Throughout the process, I was surprised with how well we synergised as a group and have learned that as long as everyone is communicating as much as possible, things will work out ultimately.
