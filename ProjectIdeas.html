							<h1 class="major">Our IT Project Idea</h1>
							<span class="image fit"></span>
						  
						  <h3>Overview:</h3>
							<p>The project that we will be making is a 2-D top-down shooter game with a mix of tower defence and survival elements which will be called “Astral Endurance”. The game engine used to develop this project will be the public version of the Unity game engine which will utilise sprites and graphical images for its display. The primary goal of the game will be seeing how long you can survive against nightly hordes of abstract alien enemies. To defend yourself against these enemies you must search for resources to create various structures and weapons.</p>
						  <h3>Motivation:</h3>
							<p>Most Tower-Defence games are designed to provide idle experiences to suit the needs of mobile users or those who don’t particularly need engaging fast-paced gameplay. Tower-defence games instead stimulate players by forcing the player to constantly think about how they choose to play, there is often an indefinite amount of time given between each round for the player to delve into strategic thought. For this game we wanted to create a gameplay cycle that shifted between the strategic thought and planning of a tower defence game and an intense fast-paced shooter. With this game we wanted to simultaneously engage the players ability to plan and think ahead and also their skills and ability to think on their feet in a quick-paced battle. </p>
						  <h2>Description:</h2>
							<h3>Gameplay Loop:</h3>
							<p>The player starts off by spending their daytime adventuring into unfamiliar territory searching for valuable resources. The player collects them in order to craft items to help fortify and arm themselves for the impending nightfall. Once nightfall commences the fractals will now start to spawn in hordes with the player needing to use their arsenal of weapons, abilities, and structures to defend themselves until the sunrise scares off the fractals.</p>
						  <h3>In-depth Game Actions:</h3>
							<p>All items, abilities and structures are created from different types of nanobots, by absorbing valuable resources nanobots can be created for different purposes.  </p>
							<p>There are 3 different types of energy derived from resources include:</p>
							<p>-          Electrical (For Hardware)</p>
							<p>-          Chemical (For Matter Creation)</p>
							<p>-          Nuclear (For Power)</p>
							<p>With these different resources you can craft materials that can help you create walls, turrets and structures to defend yourself but also ammunition, equipment and abilities to fight off the hordes of the fractals face to face. </p>
						  <h3>Level Design:</h3>
							<p>The player spawns in the centre of the map which is also the safest place point for the player to be. As the map continues outward from this spawn-point resources are more easily found, but also the dangers of daytime-fractals.  For this game I want to prioritise learning about the gameplay so by giving every player a unique level to them through random generation it would create variety between different playthroughs and give the players chances to be adaptive.</p>
						  <h3>Gameplay Conflict:</h3>
							<p>The primary conflict of the game will be fighting against the alien fractals which will be controlled by AI. The player will be able to defend themselves through a variety of means such as creating walls and structures or by creating different types of weapons and abilities. For the player and the enemy to be on equal standing the enemy will have to be just as adaptive as the player. Such as if the player can create structures easily countering the enemies, there must be a type of enemy that can destroy structures easily to make sure that the player is constantly on their toes and adapting.</p>
						  <h3>Visual Aesthetic:</h3>
							<p>The visual aesthetic for this game that we will be going for is a smooth and soft design. To achieve this aesthetic the colour scheme of the game will heavily incorporate soft pastel colour schemes consisting of oranges and pinks. Because pastel colours have neutral tones and low saturation, they appear quite soothing and calming. To further support this gentle aesthetic the artwork won’t be constructed from sprite artwork despite its efficiency in creating quick and easy visuals. But instead, the artwork will be created in Vector Based programs to be able to capture soft and geometrically clean shapes. The only downside to using the vector-based programs is that I’ll have to simplify the design and detail of everything to make them easier and quicker to make. By making the enemies abstract shapes we don’t need to create as much animation and don’t need to have the same eye for consistent detail as I would for creating human enemies. But due to the fact that this program needs to be created as a prototype as a team, we are heavily leaning away from this idea and instead towards using Pixel Art with Photoshop. This would allow more people in our group to create the designs for the game as Pixel Art is a lot more efficient to use and more easier to learn for newcomers unlike specialised Vector Programs.</p>
						  <h3>Setting premise:</h3>
							<p>You are an astronaut sent to a possibly hospitable planet in a distant galaxy to help humanity find a new place to settle. But the trip goes horribly wrong when the ship is fired upon by some sort of alien lifeform. This causes your ship to crash land killing everyone aboard except for you. Fortunately, you’re not completely helpless against this unknown threat as the MERBIUS, a vehicle capable of creating impressive nanotechnological structures survived too. You now utilise this technology to help defend yourself against the horrors of this mysterious planet.  </p>
						  <h3>Tools &amp; Technologies:</h3>
							<p>The software we will use to create the game will be the Unity Game Engine which is free for individual users. Unity is a game-engine that already has important features such as physics, collision detection and lighting/shading already built-in. The reason we chose Unity over other game engines is that although it may not be the easiest game-engine to build in, it’s more powerful than other game-engines such as Gamemaker. Although most of us have lots of previous experience in using Gamemaker for various school projects, Unity just has much more potential for the variety of projects that can be made in it. Also Unity is completely free, thus we would all be able to download the same program and create the prototype between the team. But Gamemaker requires a subscription, even if we were to try to find alternative methods in getting the full functionality of the software, there would be no real guarantee that the program would be compatible between us. </p>
							<p>For the Graphic Design work Adobe Photoshop will be utilised. Adobe Photoshop is an image editing/manipulation software. We were previously planning on using Adobe Illustrator, a vector-based graphics editor, in tandem with Adobe Photoshop. Although most of us have used both, most people in our group are a lot more comfortable with Adobe Photoshop . There are also many more alternative programs to Adobe Photoshop when compared to Adobe Illustrator, making it easier for everyone to work together even if we use different programs. Although it would be ideal to use Adobe Illustrator, using Adobe Photoshop is a lot more efficient for the time-being.</p>
						  <h3> Skills Required:</h3>
							<p>-          In-depth understanding of Unity</p>
							<p>-          Programming/Coding skills for creation of game mechanics</p>
							<p>-          Graphic design skills for 2-D artwork and sprite construction</p>
							<p>-          Understanding of game theory and level design</p>
							<p>Although some of us have tinkered around Unity, noone in our group has used it to create any meaningful artefacts/projects.  We will have to put some crunch time into this project if we want to master the basics of the Unity engine.</p>
							<p>Although most of us have not extensively used C# or Unity IDE before, most of us have experience in using game design programs and programming languages such as Gamemaker, Visual Basic and others. </p>
							<p>Almost all of us have used Adobe Photoshop or its alternatives to a good extent. Because we will all be possibly creating pixel art, it will be easier for other teammates to learn how to use it to create new assets. It will also be easier to create a more consistent art design because of how simple the artwork is.</p>
						  <h3>Outcome:</h3>
							<p>If the outcome of this project successfully meets all my goals, then we will be filling a niche within the gaming industry that encompasses both the craving of Tower-Defence players along with Fast-paced Shooters. If this project feels fun and unique after completion, some of us may try to expand upon the original scope of the project in our own time by incorporating more advanced features. </p>
